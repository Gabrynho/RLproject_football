# Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods for Google Research Football RL Environment

This is my Reinforcement Learning project for the *Reinforcement Learning* course taught by Prof. Antonio Celani, from the *Data Science & Artificial Intelligence* M.Sc Course at the University of Studies of Trieste (UNITS)  

This repo is a fork from the [Google Research Football Repository](https://github.com/google-research/football) and aims to implement a Deep Q-Network to train an Agent to play on its own.

For further information, please refer to the PowerPoint presentation in this repo, which provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical framework, algorithmic explanations, training structure and results achieved.

## Configuration
For Linux machines, a [bash script](https://github.com/Gabrynho/RLproject_football/blob/master/configurationlinux.sh) is provided to facilitate the cloning of this repository. It is hoped that this script will function as intended, although it is possible that some packaging installations may have been overlooked in the conda environment. This is unlikely to present a significant issue.
